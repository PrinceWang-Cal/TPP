Algorithm is as follows:

    Start from soda
    
    if no edge to any unvisited home in current locationï¼š
        then run Dijkstra to find the next home
    else:
        Choose the shortest path to the next home
    (due to triangular inequality, going to a home that is your neighbor is always closer than going through some other route)
    
    repeat until no home is not visited.
    
    Go back to Soda
